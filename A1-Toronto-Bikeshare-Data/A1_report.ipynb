    "\n",
    "One advantage of living in downtown Toronto is the variety of ways of public transportation available, including bike sharing systems. Although I have never used Toronto Bike Share yet, there is a station right next to my residence building on campus, and another at the cross-section of Willcocks Street and St. George Street where I pass by every day. I have seen people using bikes at these stations pretty often, and it would be interesting to investigate the distribution of trip lengths, as well as how they vary with different user types and changes in season and weather.\n",

Another interesting observation is that there is a line at duration = 1 second and distance = 0m. These points may appear due to different types of errors, such as error in docking the bike, or registration problems in the database.  \n",

    "- The effect of weather in difference seasons may be different. In future analysis, we can run the algorithm on different quarters.\n",
    "- The weather conditions on a day may not be independent. We may need to analyze using multiple variables such as temperature and precipitation at the same time to determine what might affect the mean trip length on a specific day.\n",
    "- The mean distance/duration may not be representative of the total ridership activity on one day."

    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "We can measure the trip length of Toronto Bikeshare trips using two definitions, one is trip duration time and the other is trip distance between the start station and the stop station. The two definitions are positively correlated, but is not equivalent because the speed of a trip depends on a lot of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trips by casual users tend to have longer duration time than members, which may indicate different purposes to use the bike. \n",
    "\n",
    "On days of bad weather such as rain or snow, the trip duration and distance would decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas for Bike Share Toronto\n",
    "- The high number of trips starting and ending at the same station, especially for casual users, is an interesting phenomenon worth investigating. If it is caused by difficulty to use the facility for the same time, Bike Share Toronto may want to have more clear instructions or improve the docking facility.\n",
    "- It would be interesting to further investigate what causes the difference in trip duration between casual users and members. It is possible to infer the purpose of trips by looking at the most popular routes on the map, and explore that if casual users are using the bike share system more often for travel."
